# UHShield App
## Installation Guide
### Precondition: 
Users have to install XCode under MacOS envrionment since it is a iOS platform application. We strongly recommend running our app on the latest version of XCode. 

Having a ios mobile device is important for testing all features in the app(some feature are not supported on the XCode simulator)
### Step 1:
Clone the repo to your local computer, and open the project "UHShield.xcworkspace".
